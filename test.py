================================
Topic extraction with Tensor LDA
================================

This example is modified from scikit-learn's "Topic extraction with
Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation"
example.

This example applies :class:`tensor_lda.tensor_lda.TensorLDA`
on the 20 news group dataset and the output is a list of topics, each
represented as a list of terms (weights are not shown).
